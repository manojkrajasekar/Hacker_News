               <font size ="3"> &#8680;The entire scientific Python stack was essentially relying upon on the “free time” work of only about 30 people—and no one had funding!
                30 people? I remember a time when a certain fruit company would enter a field, literally hire all 30 of those guys, and put them behind closed doors. Then in 2 years they'd dominate the field for the next decade.
                Are these guys turning down offers? Or is the fruit company that poorly managed now?</font>
