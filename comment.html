While I don't want anyone using the old r protocols, I also don't really want transparent redirects to other protocols. What if a Debian user was in the habit of using "rcp file somehost" and found themselves working on a non-Debian system where rcp was not linked to a secure command?

Somewhere in RAM there's probably at one point a representation of the image with at least 3 bits per pixel.It's been so long since I've worked with that kind of thing I didn't really even think through what an odd comment it is to suggest that serial consoles on routers are a good reason to keep rsh around in a default FreeBSD install.

I don't know how one would use telnet or rlogin to talk to a, say, Cisco, router over RS232. You'd have to jump through some serious hoops, I would think, to use rlogin or telnet.
